# SimpleKanban Backlog

This is our own backlog for SimpleKanban development — we dogfood our own tool to plan and track features.

Using SimpleKanban to manage SimpleKanban lets us:
- Experience the tool as real users do
- Discover pain points and missing features firsthand
- Keep our backlog version-controlled alongside our code
- Demonstrate the git-based workflow we're building for

## Card Template

New cards should follow this structure:

## Description

What needs to be done and why.

## Requirements

- Specific, testable requirements
- Acceptance criteria

## Notes

Implementation notes, related files, or context.
