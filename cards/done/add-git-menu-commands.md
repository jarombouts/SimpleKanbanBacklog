## Description

Add menu bar commands for git operations in addition to the toolbar indicator.

## Requirements

- Git menu or add to existing menu:
  - Push (Cmd+Shift+P or similar)
  - Sync Now (manual fetch + pull)
  - Show status in menu

## Notes

Currently git sync only has toolbar UI. Menu commands would improve discoverability and keyboard-first workflows.
