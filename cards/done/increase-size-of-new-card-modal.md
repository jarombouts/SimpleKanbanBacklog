The "new card" modal is quite tiny, taking up approx 400x300 px, and not responsive to screen size. please enlarge it to start at a minimum of 400 px wide x 640 px high (portrait orientation), enlarging with the window size to a maximum of 800 px wide by 1280 px high if there is enough padding around to retain approx 25% of the modal dimensions around it (eg board window is 1800 wide x 1000 high: retain 25% of 1000 = 250 px above, 250 px below new card modal. ratain 25% of 1800 = 450 px to the left and 450 px to the right of the modal.
