# SimpleKanban Backlog

This is our own backlog for SimpleKanban development — we dogfood our own tool to plan and track features.

**Location:** This board lives in its own repository at `../SimpleKanbanBacklog` (separate from the main SimpleKanban project repo). This demonstrates the recommended setup: one repo per board for clean git sync.

Using SimpleKanban to manage SimpleKanban lets us:
- Experience the tool as real users do
- Discover pain points and missing features firsthand
- Test the git sync feature with a real remote
- Demonstrate the git-based workflow we're building for
