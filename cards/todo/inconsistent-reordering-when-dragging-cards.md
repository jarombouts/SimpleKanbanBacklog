When dragging a card, the existing (non dragged) cards correctly reposition themselves so a "gap" opens up below the mouse cursor, showing where a card would be dropped if the mouse is released. However, sometimes (not always) when releasing the mouse, the card ends up in an incorrect position. Please investigate!
