When editing an existing card, or creating a new card, there should be a button to add new label names + set the label color

## Notes

**Dependency:** First implement "Config button to edit board.md" which creates the settings infrastructure. Label management can then be added as a section within that settings panel, and optionally a quick-add button in the card editor that links to it.
