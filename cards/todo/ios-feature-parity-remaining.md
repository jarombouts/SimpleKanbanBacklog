## Description

Remaining iOS features needed to reach parity with macOS version.

## Requirements

### Column Management
- [ ] Column collapse/expand (tap header or swipe)
- [ ] Column settings (rename, reorder, delete)

### Label Management
- [ ] Create new labels from iOS
- [ ] Edit label colors
- [ ] Filter by label (popover/sheet)

### Board Settings
- [ ] Edit board title
- [ ] Manage columns and labels
- [ ] Card template editing

### Editor Enhancements
- [ ] Markdown syntax highlighting
- [ ] Undo/redo support

### iPad-specific
- [ ] Pointer/trackpad hover states
- [ ] Split View multitasking
- [ ] Slide Over support
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh for sync

## Notes

These can be implemented incrementally. Priority should be:
1. Column collapse/expand (high usage)
2. Label management (currently can't create labels on iOS)
3. Undo/redo (important for editing)
4. Rest as polish items
